# Path Finding Algorithms Visualizer

Welcome to the Path Finding Algorithms Visualizer README! This project is a Java-based visualizer that helps understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Witness the pathfinding algorithms in action through animated visualizations.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Explore different pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and more.
- **Customization**: Customize the start and end points, obstacle placement, and algorithm speed to observe different scenarios.
- **Step-by-Step Mode**: Step through each iteration of the pathfinding algorithm to gain a deeper understanding of the process.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java code using an IDE or the command line.
3. Select a maze generating algorithm
4. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the available options.
5. Customize the start and end points, as well as obstacle placement, if desired.
6. Adjust the algorithm speed to observe the pathfinding process.
7. Click the "Start" button to initiate the visualization.
8. Observe the animation and the changes in real-time.
9. Analyze the algorithm's efficiency and behavior.
